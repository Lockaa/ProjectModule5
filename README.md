# Module 5: Fullstack Project
# Task 5:
    Complete a full-stack web application project that integrates front-end (React), back-end (Node.js), and database (MongoDB).

# Assignment:
    Build a simple blog or e-commerce website:
    - Create a front-end using React that displays posts or products.
    - Implement a back-end using Node.js and Express to handle CRUD operations for posts or products.
    - Use MongoDB for storing data.

# Deliverables:
    A full-stack web application project (React for the front-end, Node.js/Express for the back-end, MongoDB for the database).

    2/17/2025:

    2/18/2025:
    okay, I'm going to do a blog type website instead
    working on front end                                                                        12:30 - 15:00
    Trying to understand MongoDB so I can have posts 'save' between refreshs closing            15:00 - 15:30

    2/19/2025:
    Working on MongoDB connection                                                               11:30 - 13:00
    turns out I basically have to redo my front end                                             13:00
    reworking basically everything                                                              13:00 - 14:30
    trying to get my 'DELETE' route to work (it's not)                                          14:30 - 15:30

    Finished                                                                                    15:30

    Total hours logged:                                                                         12.75

# Challenges:
    Setting everything up initially, figuring out just exactly I have to do.
    Understanding MongoDB, how to use it, and how to impliment it.

    Getting the 'delete' route to function as intended, I have add, and post, so you can add blog posts and they're saved, but I can't seem to delete them at current time (15:20). I genuinely don't see what's wrong with my code. (I tried for the sake of it, just feeding it into ChatGPT, and it's not finding my error either).

# Possible improvements:
    Having a 'log in' page where each person has their own set of blog posts
    (while not in usual social media fashion or convention) having a button to edit one's post after posting
