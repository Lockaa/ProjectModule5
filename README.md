# Module 5: Fullstack Project
# Task 5:
    Complete a full-stack web application project that integrates front-end (React), back-end (Node.js), and database (MongoDB).

# Assignment:
    Build a simple blog or e-commerce website:
    - Create a front-end using React that displays posts or products.
    - Implement a back-end using Node.js and Express to handle CRUD operations for posts or products.
    - Use MongoDB for storing data.

# Deliverables:
    A full-stack web application project (React for the front-end, Node.js/Express for the back-end, MongoDB for the database).
